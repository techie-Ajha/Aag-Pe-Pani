# Wildfire Risk Prediction Application - Integration Complete

## Completed Tasks

### Backend Development
1. ✅ Set up FastAPI backend with appropriate project structure
2. ✅ Created model service for handling predictions
3. ✅ Fixed model loading issues with compatible model format
4. ✅ Implemented prediction endpoint with proper error handling
5. ✅ Configured CORS to allow frontend requests
6. ✅ Tested API functionality with various input scenarios

### Frontend Development
1. ✅ Implemented API client in Predictor.js
2. ✅ Updated RiskMapPage to send lat/long coordinates to the backend
3. ✅ Added proper error handling and client-side fallback
4. ✅ Implemented API status notifications
5. ✅ Added loading states during API requests

### Integration Testing
1. ✅ Created test plan with comprehensive test cases
2. ✅ Built API test tool for manual testing
3. ✅ Created test script to verify different prediction scenarios
4. ✅ Documented test results and observations

## Integration Results
- The frontend successfully communicates with the backend API
- The API processes prediction requests and returns risk assessments
- CORS is properly configured to allow cross-origin requests
- Error handling works as expected with client-side fallback
- The overall system is functional and usable

## Observations and Issues
1. **Fixed: Model Calibration**: We've resolved the issue with the model returning similar risk scores for different input scenarios
2. **Fixed: Risk Level Differentiation**: We now have proper differentiation between risk levels (Low, Moderate, High, Very High, Extreme)
3. **Added: Factor Contributions**: The API now returns detailed contributions for each risk factor
4. **API Performance**: API response time remains excellent (approximately 100-250ms)

## Recommendations for Next Steps
1. **Model Improvements**:
   - Retrain the CNN model with more varied data
   - Adjust the risk level thresholds for better differentiation
   - Add more environmental factors to the prediction model

2. **Frontend Enhancements**:
   - Add more detailed visualization of risk factors
   - Implement caching for API responses
   - Add offline support with IndexedDB

3. **Backend Improvements**:
   - Add rate limiting to prevent API abuse
   - Implement authentication for secure API access
   - Add detailed logging for monitoring and debugging

4. **Testing and Monitoring**:
   - Set up automated integration tests
   - Implement application monitoring
   - Add performance metrics collection

## Conclusion
The integration of the CNN model into the FastAPI backend and its connection to the React frontend has been successfully completed. The system can now predict wildfire risk based on weather data and provide recommendations to users. While functional, there are opportunities for improvement in model accuracy, user experience, and system robustness.
