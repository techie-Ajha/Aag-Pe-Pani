## 🔥 Project Overview

EmberEye helps communities prepare for and mitigate wildfire risks through:

- **AI-powered risk prediction**: Analyzes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and vegetation to calculate risk levels
- **Interactive map visualization**: Displays regional risk levels with color-coded zones
- **Real-time weather data integration**: Connects to OpenWeatherMap API for current weather conditions
- **Personalized recommendations**: Provides safety suggestions based on location risk profiles

## 🚀 Features

- **Predictive AI Model**: Advanced algorithms assess risk based on environmental factors and historical data
- **Real-time Data**: Live weather data from OpenWeatherMap API for up-to-the-minute accuracy
- **Regional Risk Levels**: Color-coded visualization of risk zones using Leaflet maps
- **Interactive UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface built with React and enhanced with Framer Motion animations

## 📋 Pages

- **Home**: Introduction to the application with key features overview
- **Risk Map**: Interactive map with location-based risk assessment tool
- **How It Works**: Explanation of the prediction methodology
- **Resources**: Educational material and preparedness information
- **Contact**: Feedback form and support resources

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, React Router 7
- **UI/Animation**: Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS
- **Map Visualization**: Leaflet, React Leaflet
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts
